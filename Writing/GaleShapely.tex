\KwResult{There are no pairs $(O_i, S_i), (O_j, S_j)$ such that the pairings $(O_i, S_j), (O_j, S_i)$ would be preferred by all parties.} 
 Consider a set of preferences $\{P^{x}_{y,z} \in \mathbb{Z}^+: x \in \{O,S\}, y \in \{1, \dots, n\}, z \in \{1, \dots, m\}\}$. This indicates the positive integer preference ranking of either the job owner or seeker ($O$ or $S$) for the $n$ available jobs and $m$ seekers. Also know that $l_n$ is the number of available positions in each job.\;
 \For{$c \in \{1, \dots, n\}$}{
 For each job, initialize the job owner's hiring slate to be empty \;
 $O_c = \{\null\}$ \;
 } 
 \For{$c \in \{1, \dots, m\}$}{
 For each job seeker initialize their indicator to say \textit{un-slated} \;
 $I_c = 0$ \;
 Also initialize to look at the first preference of each job seeker \;
 $g_c = 1$\;
 } 
 Check if there are more jobs than seekers, or more seekers than jobs \;
 $a = \max \big(0, m - \sum_{c = 1}^n l_c \big)$\;
 Seek jobs until either all seekers are hired or all jobs are spoken for \;
 \While{\big( $\sum_{c = 1}^m I_c \leq a $ \big)}{
 Iterate through all the job seekers \;
 \For{$c \in \{1, \dots, m\}$}{
 Find a job for a seeker $c$ only if they are not slated for a job \;
 \If{$I_c == 0$}{
 Look for the job that is seeker $c$'s $g^{th}$ preference \;
 $j = r$ such that $P^S_{r,c} = g_c$ \;
 If job $j$ has open positions \;
  \uIf{$|O_j| < l_j$}{
   Add the seeker $c$ to the slate of owner of job $j$ \;
   $O_j += S_c$\;
   Indicate that seeker $c$ tentatively has a job \;
   $I_c = 1$\;
   }
   Or if seeker $c$ preferred by job owner $j$ than their least preferred person currently on their slate \;
   \ElseIf{$P^{O}_{j,c} < P^{O}_{j,w} $ such that $P^{O}_{j,w} = \max \{P^{O}_{j,v} | S_v \in O_j\}$}{
   Remove the seeker $w$ (least preferred) from the slate of owner of job $j$ \;
   $O_j -= S_w$\;
   Indicate that seeker $w$ tentatively does not have a job \;
   $I_w = 0$\;
   Add the seeker $c$ to the slate of owner of job $j$ \;
   $O_j += S_c$\;
   Indicate that seeker $c$ tentatively has a job \;
   $I_c = 1$\;
